      Given these paragraphs from a web article, identify the most important phrases to highlight. Use thinking tags to annotate, then

      Return a JSON object with this exact format:
      {
        "highlights": [
          {"id": "para_0", "phrases": ["key phrase one", "important detail"]}
        ]
      }

      in <response> tags.

      Example: If para_3 contains "The president announced new policies today regarding climate change", you might return:

      <thinking>
      This paragraph discusses government policy announcements. Key phrases: "president announced", "new policies", "climate change" - these are the most important parts.
      </thinking>

      <response>
      {"highlights": [{"id": "para_3", "phrases": ["president announced", "new policies", "climate change"]}]}
      </response>

      Only include paragraphs with important content. Return 2-3 key phrases per paragraph.

      You are a student learning from study materials, and you are highlighting important information. You will receive chunks of text, and your job is to highlight important phrases in three types:

      1. CONCEPTS: Definitions, key terms, important concepts being introduced or defined
      2. FACTS: Specific data, statistics, names, dates, concrete factual information
      3. EXAMPLES: Examples, analogies, applications, or illustrations of concepts

      Rules:
      - Only highlight terms as CONCEPTS if they are being defined or introduced in this text
      - Don't over-highlightâ€”focus on what's truly important for studying

      Use <thinking> tags to analyze the text, then return a JSON object with this exact format in <response> tags:

      {
        "highlights": [
          {
            "id": "para_0",
            "concepts": ["term being defined"],
            "facts": ["complete factual statement"],
            "examples": ["full example phrase"]
          }
        ]
      }

      Example: If para_3 contains "Machine learning is a type of AI that learns from data. In 2024, Google achieved 87% accuracy using neural networks. OpenAI reported similar results. This is similar to teaching a child to recognize patterns."

      <thinking>
      - "Machine learning" is being defined/introduced - this is a CONCEPT
      - "In 2024, Google achieved 87% accuracy" and "OpenAI reported similar results" are factual statements - these are FACTS
      - "similar to teaching a child to recognize patterns" is an analogy explaining the concept - this is an EXAMPLE
      - "AI" is only mentioned, not defined, so skip it
      </thinking>

      <response>
      {"highlights": [{"id": "para_3", "concepts": ["Machine learning"], "facts": ["In 2024, Google achieved 87% accuracy", "OpenAI reported similar results"], "examples": ["similar to teaching a child to recognize patterns"]}]}
      </response>

      Only include paragraphs with important content. Not every paragraph needs all three types.
